# tinyrenderer-rust

Implementing the Dmitry V. Sokolov (ssloy) tinyrenderer in rust.

The goal at first is port the main logic to rust with minimal changes besides maybe rust specialities.

### Progress

Just some images that were generated while coding.

#### Lesson 2 - Triangle rasterization and back face culling
